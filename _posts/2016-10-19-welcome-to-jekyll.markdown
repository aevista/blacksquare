The first blog post. In all honesty, I am probably going to delete this, but as a filler, this will do for now. 

So things are finally going. I have just graduated college, and it feels amazing being out. I've moved back in with the parents. Typical college thing, so I'm not too ashamed, but some pretty awesome events have occurred since graduation. I can now proudly say that I am a Data Engineer for L-3 Comcept. I feel very fortunate being able to be apart of the company. I have not yet started, but there seems to be quite a bit of things to learn whilst there. I feel very fortunate to say that I've received such an offer at such a time in my life. Jobless for 2 months after college was not all that bad. 

So anyways, that's where I am in my life right now. Ideally in the future, I'll be much more comfortable in the field, and I really hope to puruse web development as a hobby. There's so many areas of coding to explore. Web development and Data Engineering are two completely different fields from another, but two fields that I am excited to get better at.
