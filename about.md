I am Andrew. I am a developer. I enjoy writing code. 
<br/><br/>
I currently work at L-3 Comcept as a Data Engineer. 
<br/><br/>
Programming is an art that fascinates me. To the creativity side of web design, the logical side of algorithmic desgin, and the organizational side of OO concepts. There is an endless sea of means to explore the craft. 
<br/><br/>
As of right now, outside of coding, my interests include watching stand up comedy. I would have to say Bill Bur and John Mulaney are probably my favorite as of now. I enjoy the casual beer drinking. I would have to say that right now I enjoy a good Saison or a Sour. 
<br/><br/>
I enjoy travelling and would like to do that very much more in the future. Japan has been ofically marked off the list, and hopefully Denmark is the next place to go
